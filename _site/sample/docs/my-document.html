<p>Hello there, this is content again. I should be able to call variables in the content of my file like this: .</p>

<ol>
<li>We can also have lists,</li>

<li>With numbers or bullets,</li>
</ol>

<p>And finally (obviously) load pictures <img alt='This is a picture' src='../files/pic.jpg' />. Files are stored in the &#8220;files&#8221; folder of the github repository where we store our content.</p>
